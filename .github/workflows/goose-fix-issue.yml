            I tried to fix this issue, but didn't make any changes to the codebase.
            
            This might be because:
            1. The issue description wasn't clear enough
            2. The issue requires more complex changes than I can handle automatically
            3. The issue might be invalid or already fixed
            
            Please provide more details or assign this to a human developer.
